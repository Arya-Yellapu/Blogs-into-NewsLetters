# Blogs-into-NewsLetters

The End User can drop in their mail ids and the urls seperated by commas(if there are multiple websites) of the blog websites where they want the content to be received to their inboxes on a frequency.

The Users mail and the link preference would be added to the database.

Then the Rest API can be scheduled as per the frequency which will mail the content to their respective mail addresses.
